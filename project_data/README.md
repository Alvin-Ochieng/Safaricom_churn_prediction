# SAFARICOM CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION USING CLASSIFICATION MODELS
Customer satisfaction and retention is critical for any company because it is the force of a company's sales and also ensures that they maximize their profit.
Subscribers who are dissatisfied with a product are most likely to cancel their subscription. 
If a subscriber cancels a contract or a subscription with one service provider then the subscriber is called a ‘lost’ or ‘churned’ customer.
Customer acquisition can cost 5 to 25 times more than customer retention, this means that the logical strategy is to concentrate resources retaining customers than acquiring new ones.
This study focuses on identifying the reasons behind a customer leaving a service and who is likely to move using classification models.
This will help companies to come no with preventive measures against customer churn.
